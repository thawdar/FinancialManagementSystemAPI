# FinancialManagementSystemAPI
This is just a program for an assignment.

I used to consider frequently how to record my daily incomes and expenses in my computer or phone. I usually keep record manually in my note book. But it is not very easy to known the total amount of what I spent and total revenue by categories. For this information system projects, I have decided to make a small financial management system to fulfill requirement of mine and other individual person and also organization to minimize overall paperwork. I studied to create a financial management system on the internet and test beta version of financial management system also. I realized that I have to do many things with it, such as, creating chart of accounts, keeping all payments, payable and receivable, keeping track of liabilities, management of general accounting procedure, manage the budget, balancing all cash and bank accounts and ensuring data security, consistency and accuracy. It is quite sure to be unfinished within an academic year by my effort and current knowledge, I will be done a mini financial management system which reduce complexity of accounting system, reduce paper work, utilize and capable to use many users. 

###### According to my findings of research, I will do the following basic things for my project
